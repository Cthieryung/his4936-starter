	I would like to use this data to explore the vagrancy laws in New Orleans.  There was a law on
    the books, order 13974, which was used to arrest people for vagrancy.  At this same time, the
    county could still use its prisoners as a labor force.  I believe the two are connected.  
    I believe that the county put this law on the books so that it could arrest more people and
    use them to work on roads and other public works.

    My data source is the New Orleans Police Department arrest record form he year 1900.  I was
    given copies of the originals and transcribed them into a spreadsheet for easier analysis.  
    Once in the spreadsheet, it had to be cleaned to make it actually useful.  I used Open Refine
    for this process.  Beyond the cleaning process, I would like to put this database into Tableau
    and see what I can find out.
